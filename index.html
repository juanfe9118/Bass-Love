		  <h1>Bass Love</h1>
		  <p>The bass guitar is an instrument that not many people like or would even say "I wanna play that, it looks cool." To be honest, most people that get into playing bass don't do it by choice, they either started out as guitar players or drummers and then were forced to pick up the bass due to unavailability of bass players out there. But if there is one thing all bass players would agree on, is that once you have started playing it, there is no putting it down. </p>
		  <h2>My Personal Experience</h2>
		  <p>I first started playing the bass out of need, the band I was playing with no longer needed a keys player and needed a bass player. So they basically gave me an ultimatum either I picked up the bass or I played keys for a different band. Needless to say I picked up the bass, and, since I did it, I've fallen completely in love with it. At first I was reluctant to pick up the instrument, partly because I didn't really understand its function within a band setting and because usually the bass player doesn't get any "spotlight," it wasn't very attractive the idea of being one. Nonetheless, the coolness of the instrument and the love you develop for the low end more than make up for the lack of recognition.</p>
		  <h3>Why Is The Bass So Mesmerizing?</h3>
		  <p>I believe the reason why the bass is an instrument that captivates the heart of every person that dares get into it, is because of its versatility. Not only is the bass present in all music styles and genres, but it also allows a wide array of sound with just your bass guitar; unlike the attention-grabbing electric guitar that requires a wide array of effect pedals to accomplish what the bass accomplishes with just a good set of hands.<br>Another appealing side of the bass is that it is very easy to start playing it, with just a few notes you can already play an entire song with a band. But you can also make it as complex as you want it to, giving you more options at the moment you play.</p>
		  <h3>Types of Basses</h3>
		  <p>Not only is the bass a very versatile instrument that needs virtually no additional accesories added to it to sound awesome in any song, but there's many types of basses out there that suit any playing style. We'll cover them more in depth in our <a href="basses.html">basses</a> section. But to get a preview of them there are basses with both active and passive circuits. There are 4, 5, and 6 string basses, and pretty much anything you can imagine.</p>
