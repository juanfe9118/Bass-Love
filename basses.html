		  <h1>Here you will find interesting information about the most popular basses in the market.</h1>
		  <h3>P-Bass</h3>
		  <img id="smart_thumbnail" src="http://media.fmicdirect.com/fender/images/products/guitars/0170306703_frt_wmd_001.png" alt="" width="460" class="small">
		  <p>The precision bass or p-bass was the first bass ever created. This bass is particularly popular because of its "precision" style pick-up which reduces noise and has a dark tone. This bass is more common to have 4 strings, although 5-string models are available.</p>
		  <h3>Jazz Bass</h3>

		  <p>The jazz bass or j-bass is one of the most, if not the most, used bass out there. It features two single coil pick ups, with, in most cases, an active circuit; although passive circuit models are also widely available. It can be found in both 4-string and 5-string models.</p>
		  <h3>PJ Bass</h3>
		  <img id="pj_bass" src="https://www.stickpng.com/assets/images/580b585b2edbce24c47b28a2.png" alt="" width="450" class="small">
		  <p>The pj bass, as you can probably guess, is a combination between the precision bass and the jazz bass. It features a single coil jazz bass pick up along with a precision split coil pick up. This one can also be found in 4-string and 5-string models with both passive and active circuits.</p>
		  <h3>The 6-String Bass</h3>
		  <img id="six_bass" src="https://www.deanguitars.com/images/productimages_th/e6selbrl.png" alt="" width="450" class="small">
		  <p>The six string bass, like its name would suggest, has 6 strings. Because of its sixth stings it can reach tones well into the electric guitar spectrum. It is widely used by bassist who also want to do soloes. And it can come in an array of configurations, from single coil pick ups to humbuckers to soapbars; most feature an active circuit.</p>
