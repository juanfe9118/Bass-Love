		  <h1>Brief history of the Bass Guitar</h1>
		  <p>To fully understand the role of the Precision Bass in the decade of its arrival, itâ€™s important to understand the times and circumstances into which it was introduced. Its predecessor was the age-old upright bass, a large, bulky instrument that took up a lot of space in the touring bus and had become increasingly difficult to hear as bands grew louder. Given the brash horn sections that provided the main voice of many dance bands, the inherent loudness of drum kits and the advent of better electrified guitars with better amplification, something needed to be done for bass.<p>
		  <p>It was because of this need that Clarence Leo Fender (Yes! as in Fender Guitars) created the first ever electric bass and released it in October 1951. It was the precision bass, the instrument the revolutionized music forever, and will forever give Leo a place in history.</p>
